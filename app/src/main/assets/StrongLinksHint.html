		<h2>{0}</h2>

			This technique relies on <b>Conjugate Pairs</b>.
			The value <b>{1}</b> in <b>{2}</b> and <b>{3}</b> forms
			{4} (regional) strong links or conjugate pairs with {5} set(s) of <i>bridge</i> cells
			in <b>{6}</b> and <b>{7}</b>. The {4} strong links are joined therefore with
			{5} <i>weak</i> link(s).
		</p>
		<p>
			Any occurrence of the value <b>{1}</b> can be removed from any cells sharing
			a region or regions with <i>both start and end</i> cells <b>{8}</b> and <b>{9}</b>.

			This technique is closely related to {10} technique logic, Coloring
			technique or L1-Wing technique. It is a subcategory of X-Chains group of techniques
			which is in itself a subgroup of Alternating Inference Chains (AIC) group of techniques.
			These use strong links in <u>L</u>ocation inferred from <u>1</u> value (L1), therefore,
			<b>L1-Wing</b> can be used to describe this pattern (Currently L1 is used with 3 strong
			links only).
