  <h2>{2}</h2>
  <p>
   In <b>{4}</b> (outlined), all the cells with value <g>{3}</g> (highlighted) are close
   enough to each other in a way that forces the elimination of value(s) <r>{1}</r>
   (marked in red if present).
  </p>
  <p>
   These <r>values</r> can be safely eliminated through non consecutive rules, otherwise
   (if any were true), the value <g>{3}</g> would be completely removed from <b>{4}</b>
   which can't happen in a valid puzzle.
