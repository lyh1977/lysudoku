	<h2>WXYZ-Wing {11}{9}{10}</h2>
		<p>
			The four cells <b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>, <b>{2}</b> and <b>{3}</b>
			form an <b>WXYZ-Wing</b>: The three cells  <b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>,
			and <b>{2}</b> form an almost locked set linked to the bivalue
			cell <b>{3}</b> through the value <b>{8}</b>. If the value <b>{4}</b>
			was eliminated from all 4 cells of the Wing then the remaining
			value <b>{8}</b> in cell <b>{3}</b> would force the remaining 3
			cells to have only 2 possible candidates to fill them.
			That is impossible!
		</p>
		<p>
			Other occurrences of the <b>value {4}</b> can therefore be removed
			from any cells sharing a {12} with all Wing cells
			containing the <b>value {4}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The largest cell of the wing has {9} candidates and all 4 cells of
			the WXYZ-Wing pattern have a total of {10} candidates.
