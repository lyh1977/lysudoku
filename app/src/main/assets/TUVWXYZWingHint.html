	<h2>TUVWXYZ-Wing {12}{10}{11}</h2>
		<p>
			The seven cells <b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>, <b>{15}</b>, <b>{14}</b>, <b>{2}</b>, <b>{3}</b> and
			<b>{4}</b> form a <b>TUVWXYZ-Wing</b>: The six cells  <b>{0}</b>, 
			<b>{1}</b>, <b>{15}</b>, <b>{14}</b>, <b>{2}</b> and <b>{3}</b> form an almost locked set 
			linked to the bivalue cell <b>{4}</b> through the value <b>{9}</b>. 
			If the value <b>{5}</b> was eliminated from all 7 cells of the 
			Wing then the remaining value <b>{9}</b> in cell <b>{4}</b> would 
			force the remaining 6 cells to have only 5 possible candidates to 
			fill them. That is impossible!
		</p>
		<p>
			Other occurrences of the <b>value {5}</b> can therefore be removed
			from any cells sharing a {13} with all Wing cells
			containing the <b>value {5}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The largest cell of the wing has {10} candidates and the 6 cells of
			the ALS have a total of {11} candidates.
