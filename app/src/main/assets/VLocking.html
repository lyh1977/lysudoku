  <h2>{2}</h2>
  <p>
   <b>{0}</b> <u>Must</u> have a cell with <g><b>value {1}</b></g> in the solution.
</p>
  <p>
   <r>Other occurrences of <g><b>value {1}</b></g></r> outside <b>{0}</b> which
   intersect (share region/regions) with <b><u>all cells</u></b> with <g><b>value {1}</b></g>
   in <b>{0}</b> can be safely eliminated. This technique covers pointing & claiming and can
   be thought of as Generalized intersections or Locked Candidates technique that suits variant
   regions specifically.
