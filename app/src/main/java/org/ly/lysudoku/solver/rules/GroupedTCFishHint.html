		<h2>{0}</h2>

			This technique relies on <b>Conjugate Pairs</b> and a special
			arrangement of values in a block also known as <u><b>Empty rectangle</b></u>.
		</p>
		<p>
			The value <b>{1}</b> in <b>{6}</b> forms a strong link (conjugate pair)
			while the arrangement of cells with value <b>{1}</b> in  <b>{7}</b> forms
			a pattern known as Empty rectangle where all cells with value <b>{1}</b>
			(orange cell outline or yellow cell background) can be mapped on one row and one column.
			The <i>bridge</i> cell <b>{3}</b> shares <b>{8}</b> with some cell(s) that have the
			value <b>{1}</b> in <b>{7}</b> therefore forming a weak link.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any occurrence of the value <b>{1}</b> can therefore be
			removed from any cells sharing a {9}
			with both <i>start</i> cell <b>{2}</b> and <b>{7}</b> cells
			with value <b>{1}</b> that are not part of <b>{8}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This technique is similar to a 2x2 Finned Franken X-Wing technique logic. It
			is worth noting that some variants like "Disjoint groups" and "Windows" can
			display the same pattern of an "Empty rectangle"
