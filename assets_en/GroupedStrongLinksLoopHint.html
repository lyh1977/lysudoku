			This technique relies on <b>Conjugate Pairs</b> that infer a strong link
			and/or a special arrangement of values in a line or block also known as
			<b>Grouped Strong Links</b> (where a strong link is inferred from groups of
			cells having the same value) that form a loop (an X-Loop). These use strong links
			in <u>L</u>ocation inferred from <u>1</u> value (L1), therefore, <b>L1-Ring</b> can
			be used to describe this loop (Currently, L1 is reserved for 3 strong links).
		</p>
		<p>
			the arrangement of cells with value <b>{1}</b> in <b>{2}</b> and <b>{3}</b>
			(Green outlined region) form strong links (conjugate pairs, shown as green values)
			or grouped strong links (orange cell outline or yellow cell background). These
			strong links are weakly linked to each other via <b>{6}</b>, <b>{7}</b> and <b>{13}</b>
			(Red outlined region) forming a loop/ring.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any occurrence of the value <b>{1}</b> can therefore be removed from
			any cells sharing a region or regions with <u><i>ALL</i></u> cells with
			value <b>{1}</b> in ANY of <b>{6}</b>, <b>{7}</b> or <b>{13}</b> outside
			of <b>{2}</b> and <b>{3}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This technique is part of more generalized technique called X-chains which in itself
			is part of more generalized technique called Alternating Inference Chains (AIC). 
		</p>
		<p>			
			This technique can also be described as <b>{10}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>			
			The grouped strong link when inferred from cells in a block that are
			arranged in one mini-row and one mini-column is also known commonly as
			"Empty rectangle".
		</p>
		<p>			
			The inference of a strong link from a group of cells with value <b>{1}</b> in
			any region can be spotted when a an "Empty mini Area (EmA)" is observed. This EmA
			could be an empty mini-Line (EmL) in a region or regions. In the case of "Empty
			rectangle" the EmA is a group of empty cells that can also be referred to as
			"Empty mini Rectangle (EmR)".
