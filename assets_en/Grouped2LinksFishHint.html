			This technique relies on <b>Conjugate Pairs</b> that infer a strong link
			and/or a special arrangement of values in a line or block also known as
			<b>Grouped Strong Links</b> (where a strong link is inferred from a groups of
			values).
		</p>
		<p>
			the arrangement of cells with value <b>{1}</b> in <b>{6}</b> and
			in  <b>{7}</b> (Green outlined regions) form strong links (conjugate pairs shown as green values) or grouped strong
			links (orange cell outline or yellow cell background). These strong links are weakly linked through <b>{8}</b> (Red outlined region).
		</p>
		<p>
			Any occurrence of the value <b>{1}</b> can therefore be removed from
			any cells sharing a {9} with all cells with value
			<b>{1}</b> in <b>{6}</b> and <b>{7}</b> that are not part of <b>{8}</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			This technique is part of more generalized technique called X- chains which in itself
			is part of more generalized technique called Alternating Inference Chains (AIC). 
		</p>
		<p>			
			This technique is similar to a Finned X-Wing technique logic.
		</p>
		<p>			
			The inference of a strong link from a group of cells with value <b>{1}</b> in
			any region can be spotted when a an "Empty mini Area (EmA)" is observed. This EmA
			could be an empty mini-Line (EmL) in a {9}. In the case of "Empty
			rectangle" the EmA is a group of empty cells that can also be referred to as
			"Empty mini Rectangle (EmR)". Variants like "Disjoint groups" and "Windows" can
			infer a strong link from cell arrangements similar to blocks.
