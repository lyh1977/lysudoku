  <h2>{4}</h2>
  <p>
   The only possible values for the <c>{0} cells {1}</c> of the
   <b1>{3}</b1> are the <g>{0} values <b>{2}</b></g>.
   Because the number of possible values matches the number of cells,
   these <g>{0} values</g> must be located in these
   <c>{0} cells</c> in any order.
  </p>
  <p>
   <r>Other potential positions</r> of any of these values can therefore be
   removed from any cell in the grid that share region/regions with all
   cells in that set with that specific value.
