	<h2>TUVWXYZ-Ring {12}{10}{11}</h2>
		<p>
			The seven cells <b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>, <b>{15}</b>, <b>{14}</b>, <b>{2}</b>, <b>{3}</b> and 
			<b>{4}</b> form a <i>double-linked</i> <b>TUVWXYZ-Wing</b>: The six 
			cells <b>{0}</b>, <b>{1}</b>, <b>{15}</b>, <b>{14}</b>, <b>{2}</b> and <b>{3}</b> form an almost 
			locked set linked to the bivalue cell <b>{4}</b> through <i>both</i> 
			values <b>{5}</b> and <b>{9}</b> therefore creating a loop (ring). Regardless 
			of the final value of cell <b>{4}</b>, the double-link would force the other 6 
			cells from the pattern to have different values to that one. The 7 different 
			values will be in 7 cells therefore forming a locked set.
		</p>
		<p>
			<b><u>Other occurrences of any of the values</u></b> of the Ring
			pattern can therefore be removed from any cells sharing a row,
			column or block with all Ring cells containing that value.
		</p>
		<p>
			The largest cell of the Ring has {10} candidates and all 6 cells of
			the ALS have a total of {11} candidates. The pattern is similar to
			a 7digit-7cell Sue de Coq (SDC).
